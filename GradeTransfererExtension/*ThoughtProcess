As a high school teacher, my district had access to a service called GradeTransferer. It was a chrome extension that allowed
us to copy grades from one website into another. Limitations made it less than useful because the services it worked for 
already had native grade transfer capabilities underway and these were platforms that probably wouldn't be used concurrently. 

I did some investigation and discovered the required format for this extension to work. I then took data from websites I used
and wrote a program to re-organize the data in the required format so that the extension could then transfer grades. 

First iterations had the program exporting data into a text file, but this proved cumbersome to use.
In order to minimize the number of clicks, I made sure the program started and ended with data in the clipboard.

I included a feature to manually edit how a student name is processed, just in case some names were commonly left out.
