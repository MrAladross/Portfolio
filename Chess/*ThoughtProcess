I wanted to create a game of chess for a tutorial series. I decided not to publish a tutorial series due to the complexity of the
resulting game and limited time. 

Methods: 

Tilemap was used for the pieces and the chess board colors
By using a tilemap, it would be very easy to add additional board colors, new pieces, and updated selection markers.

A ChessSet was created with the idea custom game modes may be implemented in the future where the piece count wasn't standard.
Each piece would derive from the same base class. The base class would use an abstract method to identify potential spaces to move. 
Pieces would check all possible move locations, then a highlighter class would enable highlight tiles on a secondary tilemap,
then the user could make his/her move.
A sound was played on move completion. 



*Special consideration was given to the pawn and the king for "En passant" and for castling
**En passant was granted a separate class because calculations couldn't be handled within the pawn class as opponent move history mattered.
***Array extension methods were used at the time the file was created to add or remove items. Lists would have been equally useful.
