These are a few of the projects I've worked on over the past couple years. Listed from most recent to least recent:

NetworkSystem  (2022)
Chess          (2021)
BubblePop      (2021)
BranchedStory  (2020)
CardClass      (2020)
GradeTransferer(2020)
KidsMath       (2019)
MemoryGame     (2019)


I included the network system as an example of a system I created that I particularly like. The core pieces are easily adaptable for multiple use cases.
The chess project was included to show a completed project. It is classical chess where two players will take turns on one device.
The bubble pop example includes the trajectory prediction. The game was eventually completed, but files are currently inaccessible.
The branched story example shows familiarity with UI.
The Card class examples show how I would structure data for something like a classical card game, or a trading card game.
The GradeTransferer extension shows my ability to take data and process it in a way to make it useful for other existing services.
The KidsMath game shows my ability to make simple but effective decisions.

The memory game example shows past bad habits that I have grown out of.
