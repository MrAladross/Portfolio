My niece was having trouble with math, so I used the 30 minutes I had at the time to write a quick app and uploaded it to her iPad. 
She practiced enough to improve from being behind in class to being at the top of her class.

It had addition and subtraction, and I also implemented a visual option as well where some circles were instantiated to match the numbers
being added or subtracted. The visual option was a toggle setting that could be turned off.

Other features included a color toggle, difficulty setting, and the option to focus on addition or subtraction.

Questions would increase in difficulty after certain score benchmarks were passed.
