A card is an easy item to create a data structure around. 

In order to get a good cross between writing game logic and displaying UI, I like to create:
-the basic data class for cards, and 
-a UI centered monobehaviour that contains a reference to the data class. 

This way, player input can be gathered from mouseposition raycasts. Basic data is gathered from the info monobehaviour, then
the data class is passed around as needed for game logic.
